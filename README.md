# go-simpleservice

Given the current design, what could be a problem? 

- Personally would use Nginx for proxy server

- `calculator.sum` is a weird naming for url path

- Personally would do `/calculator` and put operation to JSON body `{ "a": 100, "b": 200.2, "ops": "mul"}` 

- Also didn't see the high-level system architecture in document
